# Air Pollutant Dashboard
This is a dashboard of different air pollutants in an Italian city between March 2004 and April 2005 based off of the following dataset: [UCI Air Quality Dataset]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dakshbhalala/uci-air-quality-dataset)). It has 15 columns and shows the measurements of air pollutants like CO, benzene, NO2 to name a few.

The target audience for the air pollutant dashboard would be government officials and policy makers, public health officials, researchers, and environmental scientists and lobbyists. The dashboard can help them make informed, data-driven decisions by visualizing and analyzing pollution trends. Other ways the dashboard can help the target audience is the potential to compare these pollutant levels to public health risk, understanding the further relationships and interactions between pollutant compounds, and allow them to utilize the data to make policy decisions.
