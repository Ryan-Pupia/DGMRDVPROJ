The dashboard can help them make informed, data-driven decisions by visualizing and analyzing pollution trends. Other ways it can help the target audience is the potential to compare these pollutant levels to public health risk, understanding the further relationships and interactions between pollutant compounds, and allow them to utilize the data to make policy decisions.
